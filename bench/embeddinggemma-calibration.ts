// Re-calibrates CONSOLIDATE_EMBED_THRESHOLD for embeddinggemma:300m, the
// model ocpg.ts switched its default to (see the "complete the
// embeddinggemma:300m migration" spec, repo history). The threshold was
// originally calibrated against bge-m3's cosine distribution and has no
// guaranteed relationship to a different model's numbers - this measures
// the real distribution instead of assuming the value carries over.
//
// Uses the exact 26 hand-labeled pairs from the original calibration
// (8 duplicate, 8 update, 10 distinct). bench/judge.ts, which originally held
// them, was deleted 2026-09-19 when the judge model was removed; recovered
// verbatim from git history (`git show 4032d1d~1:bench/judge.ts`) rather than
// re-written from memory, so this is the same test set, not a new one.
//
// No database needed - embed() is a pure HTTP call. Uses whatever
// OCPG_OLLAMA_HOST/PORT/EMBED_MODEL are already set to (the real production
// config), so this measures the exact model/endpoint the plugin actually
// calls, not a hardcoded stand-in.
